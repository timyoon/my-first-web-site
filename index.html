<h2>WEB2이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web is built on top of the internet and utilizes technologies such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. It allows users to navigate between web pages by clicking on hyperlinks, which are typically text or images that lead to other documents or resources. These documents are often written in languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

    The web serves as a platform for information sharing, communication, and collaboration. Users can access a wide range of content, including text, images, videos, and applications, through web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Websites, online services, and various web applications contribute to the diverse and interconnected nature of the World Wide Web.</p>
